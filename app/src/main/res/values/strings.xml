    <string name="intro">Welcome to Brain Sprain! Our goal is to help alleviate your
        stress and anxiety by providing a few coping mechanisms that will help calm you down.
        How do tell if you are not calm? We measure your heart rate using a device that has a pulse sensor.
        When your heart rate reaches a thresh hold of 120 - 150 beats per minute (bpm)
        the app will notify you and you will be able to begin with a coping mechanism that was rated by you
    </string>

    <string name="connecting">Before continuing with the setup of the app make sure your bluetooth is turned on. Also
        make sure you are connected to the HC-O5 heart rate monitoring device. If you are not, go to your device settings,
        find your bluetooth settings, turn on bluetooth and pair with HC-O5. Your beats per minute will also be displayed
        on the main screen and it will also show if you are properly connected to the HC-O5 device. Press the "next button"
        below to continue.
